## 2.VGG16 model:
### https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/vgg16/VGG16  
         
## 3.Explanation about project:
       The dataset has two parts(Train,Test).The training dataset has four classes (COVID,lung_opacity,Normal,Viral_Pneumonia), the total images                         in training dataset is 16798.

       *Training Data(images): 
       COVID - 2901, lung_opacity - 4813, Normal - 8003,Viral_Pneumonia - 1081   
       *Test Data(images): 
        COVID - 715,lung_opacity - 1199, Normal - 2189,Viral_Pneumonia - 264

  The model is made by using CNN(convolutional neural network). As we donâ€™t have a large dataset so ,either you can generate image from ImageDataGenerator 
  or use transfer learning ,here we used technique Transfer learning(VGG16 model) . The training accuracy we got from the model is 94% and test accuracy 
  is 90%. 
  
  For deployment we used a gradio interface: https://www.gradio.app/docs/interface
